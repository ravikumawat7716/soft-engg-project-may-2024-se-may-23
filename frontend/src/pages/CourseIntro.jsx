          Software engineering is an engineering approach to software
          development.[1][2][3] A practitioner, a software engineer, applies the
          engineering design process to develop software. The terms programmer
          and coder overlap software engineer, but they imply only the
          construction aspect of typical software engineer workload.[4] A
          software engineer applies a software development process,[1][5] which
          involves the definition, implementation, testing, management and
          maintenance of software systems and with development of the software
          development process itself.
